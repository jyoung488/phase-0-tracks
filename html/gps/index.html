<!-- Release 4: Reflect

HTML5 semantic tags allow accessible readers to determine the importance of the page's content and make it more readable. The most useful ones are <nav> and <main> because it makes it clear what's the most important part of the page.

THe order the browser uses to display elements on the page is first the <html> element to determine that everything within it is written in HTML then <body> contains all the content to be displayed. It then reads the different elements like <main>, <section>, <article>, <nav>, <aside>, <header>, <footer>.

I learned that we can create our own snippets with Sublime and customize them as necessary. I will definitely create snippets once I find myself typing the same info over and over for every page.


The Sublime snippets was the most difficult challenge this week since it was something totally new and the various symbols used inside the snippet threw me off. I can improve my understanding by practicing creating snippets and trying them out on different file types.
