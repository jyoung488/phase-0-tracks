1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
  * Linux is an open source OS
  * Multi-user - multiple users can access system resources
  * small is beautiful
  * do one thing well
  * portability over efficiency
2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
  * A VPS is a copy of an operating system that's hosted on another server and can be accessed remotely. It allows other users to view the information on the server without actually looking into your personal computer. It's also less expensive to have a VPS than using a physical server.
3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
* Running programs as the root user could kill your harddrive and home directory. For security purposes, it's best to work as another user in the system.
