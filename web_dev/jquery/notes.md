# jQuery
* google jQuery tutorials
* w3schools.com
* take a break every 30 mins
* try.jquery.com
* take notes in Evernote for future reference
* look up some videos on Lynda.com

# strategies that worked
* w3schools.com had a straightforward guide that got me used to the syntax
* taking breaks was helpful so I didn't get bogged down
* timeboxing so I didn't keep reading up on it before trying jQuery out!
