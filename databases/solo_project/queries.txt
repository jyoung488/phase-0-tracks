1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

  Input:
    SELECT * FROM bands;
  Output:
    1|Hannibal Buress|Oct. 16|1|1
    2|Young The Giant|Oct. 22|5|1
    3|Yellowcard|Oct. 22|4|2
    4|Taking Back Sunday|Oct. 23|5|3
    5|Senses Fail|Nov. 1|5|2

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

  Input:
    UPDATE bands SET date="November 1" where id=5;

  Output:
    None

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

  Input:
    SELECT * FROM bands, venues WHERE bands.venue = venues.id;

  Output:
    1|Hannibal Buress|Oct. 16|1|1|1|The Fox Theater
    2|Young The Giant|Oct. 22|5|1|1|The Fox Theater
    3|Yellowcard|Oct. 22|4|2|2|The Regency Ballroom
    4|Taking Back Sunday|Oct. 23|5|3|3|Slim's
    5|Senses Fail|November 1|5|2|2|The Regency Ballroom

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

    Input:
      SELECT bands.name, bands.date, venues.name FROM bands JOIN venues on bands.venue = venues.id;
    Output:
      Hannibal Buress|Oct. 16|The Fox Theater
      Young The Giant|Oct. 22|The Fox Theater
      Yellowcard|Oct. 22|The Regency Ballroom
      Taking Back Sunday|Oct. 23|Slim's
      Senses Fail|November 1|The Regency Ballroom

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

    Input:
      DELETE FROM bands WHERE name="Senses Fail";
    Output:
      None
